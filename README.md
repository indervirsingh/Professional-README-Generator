## Installation
To install this, you must first clone the repository. Then while using the terminal/bash get to this repo and run the command "npm i", then run the command "npm index.js". The program will then run and ask questions regarding your project and the README.md file will be created afterwards.
## Usage
My recommendations are pretty self-explanatory, use this program to quickly create README files for your projects.
